# ECHO

ECHO is a spaced repetition flashcard web application that helps users learn and retain information using the spaced repetition learning technique. This technique is based on the concept that information is better learned and remembered when it is reviewed at increasing intervals over time.

With this app, users can create custom flashcard decks, review and practice their flashcards in a spaced repetition manner.
